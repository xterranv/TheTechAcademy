		<p>The Sky is blue because</p>
		<p>Gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions.</p> 
		<p>Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.</p> 
		<p>This is why we see a blue sky most of the time

			<h3>The Grass is greener....</h3>
			<h4>We have to hoe, Oh boy that's hard. In our own back yard.
			The idea behind the “The grass is always greener” goes back to 
			the poet Ovid (43 BC – 17 or 18 AD)</p>
